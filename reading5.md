# Reading 05: Installing Virtualbox with Linux Terminal

# Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
- Shell: A master program that can be used to launch others. 
- Terminal: A window that allows you to type commands. 
- Cli: "command line interface". A text-based interface that is used to interact with CPUs and programs.
- While graphical interfaces are best suited for certain tasks, CLIs provide advantages in flexibility, effeciency, and automation.
  
# What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
cd - Change to the "Documents" directory
ls - List files and directories in the current directory
mv old_file.txt new_file.txt  - rename "old_file.txt" to "new_file.txt"
mv file.txt ~/Desktop  - "file.txt" to the Desktop directory

# What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
- Relative path: A path considering the "home directory" only.
- Absolute path: Not restricted to one directory, allows you to switch to "etc" directory.
- Linux explained in code:
  
// Linux is an open-source operating system kernel.
// It serves as the foundation for various Linux distributions.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Linux is a kernel that manages system resources and provides a platform for running applications.\n";
    return 0;
}

# Things I want to know more about 
- What more can you do from the terminal
