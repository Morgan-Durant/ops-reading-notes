#Reading Research and Discussion #1

This topic relates to what I am studying because it is a real-world example of what hackers are capable of and what resulted. It also describes how it was able to be achieved. 

##China's Spy Chip 
How is a hardware hack different from a software hack? Unlike software hacks, hardware hacks leave a real-world trail or footprints; they can be more devastating and grant hackers long-term access.  

What are two ways spies alter hardware? Spies can alter hardware by a seeding attack or interdiction. 

Explain how the hack worked. The chip was connected to the baseboard management controller, altering information sent to the CPU. Although the implant contained small code, it communicated with outside computers capable of code more complex.  

How were investigators able to trace the chip back to the source? Investigators traced Supermicro's supply chain backwards.
