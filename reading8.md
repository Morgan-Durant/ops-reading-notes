# Reading 08: Virtualization of Windows OS

## - What is an ISO File?
An ISO file or ISO image is a file representation of an entire CD, DVD, or BD.

## - How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)? 
By using an image burner you can write ISO files, most systems will allow this without third party software. 
As long as your OS can assemble the contents, you will just need a form of removable media to transfer it to. 

# - How do you create an ISO file?
There are many free programs that allow you to create your own ISO file from a disc or collection of files you choose.

# - How do you mount an ISO file?
Customizing the file with a "disc emulator" and then choose the drive letter that the ISO file should represent. 
Even though this drive letter is a virtual drive, your OS will see it as a real one. Modern systems may automatically
create it for you, no extra applications required.
