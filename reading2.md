# Reading 2: How to Build A Computer 

## Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
A computer would still work with just a singular core, but the ability to handle only one task at a time isn't always realistic. The more cores a computer has, the better it's ability to handle several tasks simultaneously. This would come in handy if you use your computer to work on several projects at once. If you are using your computer for gaming or situations that lag would be a major problem you would want speed rather than more cores.  


## What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
When looking for a motherboard you want to find one that has enough PCI slots to account for the RAM you will use. If want to add a second hard drive, it may be best to find a motherboard with a PCI-e slot. Wi-Fi/Bluetooth compatablity/HDMI imputs/Graphics cards/ or whatever you expect to connect to the computer itself should be compatable with the motherboard you on. 


## What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
HDDs often have higher capacities of storage, and they are more affordable. If I want something that does it's job and I don't want to spend a lot of money-I'd get a HDD. If you need something faster, more durable and don't mind spending the money SSD may be the way you'd rather go. An SSD is also good if you need something portable or move around a lot.   


## Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
The main components of a computer consist of a brain (CPU), Heart (Power Supply), and an area for Storage (RAM). The additional parts are there to support these main components in some way-often with communication, connection, or temperature control.
